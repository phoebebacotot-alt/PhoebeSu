    <h2>Research Designs</h2>
    <p>It is the Overall Plan/ Blueprint of the Study. It outlines the HOW the research will be conducted and it answer the Reesearch Questions and test Hypotheses.</p>
       <h3> <strong>1. Experimental Design</strong> </h3>Uses randomization, control groups, and manipulation of variables.
        
        <p>
            Experimental design is an important research method in system development that involves manipulating one or more independent variables to measure the effect on a dependent variable. 
            </p>
                    <strong>Principles of Experimental Design</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Randomization:</strong> Random assignment of subjects or test units to groups to reduce bias.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Groups:</strong> Comparison groups that do not receive the intervention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replication:</strong> Repeating experiments to ensure reliability and generalizability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Systematic Variation</strong> Controlled variation of conditions to study variable effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blocking:</strong> Grouping similar subjects before randomization to control extraneous variables.</li>
                    </ul>
        
        <h3><strong>2. Quasi-Experimental Design</strong></h3> Lacks random assignment but allows comparison.
        
         <p>
            Quasi-experimental designs resemble experimental designs but lack random assignment. They are suitable when randomization is impractical or unethical.
            </p>
                    <strong>Common Quasi-Experimental Designs</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-Equivalent Control Group Design</strong> Random assignment of subjects or test units to groups to reduce bias.</li>
                    <li><strong>One-Group Pretest/Posttest Design</strong> Comparison groups that do not receive the intervention.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <strong>Strengths and Limitations</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Practical, feasible in real-world settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Reduced control, potential selection bias, weaker causal inference.</li>
                    </ul>
                                
        <h3><strong>3. Non-Experimental Design</strong></h3> Includes descriptive, correlational, survey, and case study research.</li>
                    <p>
            Non-experimental designs focus on observation and description rather than manipulation.
            </p>

            <strong>Types</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Descriptive Research:</strong> Describes characteristics of systems or users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correlational Research:</strong> Examines relationships between variables.</li>

   <h2> Research Methodology</h2>
    <p>It is a Systematic Procedures/ Techniques & Tools to carry out the research.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.73bfbdbc31e13b9f65314f793db8da46?rik=2MP%2f9EhWrT7NDg&riu=http%3a%2f%2f1.bp.blogspot.com%2f-gxj9EEmaKCc%2fUXfs6d3D2ZI%2fAAAAAAAAAzI%2fdRepueNwWK0%2fs1600%2fwaterfall-model-sdlc1.jpg&ehk=0IJ9Hui0IiMpnyWSxSirn9U0ECiRLT3CEu1fMei7t2s%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">Waterfall:</a></strong> Sequential and structured</li>
        <p>This approach involves a sequential process where each phase of the development process is completed before moving onto the next one. The Waterfall model is useful for projects where the requirements are well-defined and the design is stable.</p>
        
        
        
        <li><strong><a href="https://assets.asana.biz/transform/f3519623-44e4-4506-8e1f-38cb74819c58/inline-agile-agile-methodology-1-2x">Agile:</a></strong> Iterative, flexible, and collaborative</li>
        <p>Agile methodology is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. This methodology involves breaking the software development process into small, manageable chunks called sprints, which are completed in short cycles. Each sprint involves a planning meeting, daily stand-up meetings, development work, and a review and retrospective meeting.</p>
        
      

        <li><strong><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/spiral-model-process-1024x844.jpg">Spiral Model:</a></strong> Risk-driven and test-focused</li>
        <p>The spiral methodology is a risk-driven software development model that emphasizes flexibility and adaptability. It is an iterative process that involves multiple cycles of planning, designing, building, and evaluating the software. The spiral model is particularly suitable for large and complex hardware development projects where the requirements and objectives are not well understood, and the risks associated with the project are high.</p>

        <p>The V-model methodology is a modified version of the traditional Waterfall model. It is an extension of the Waterfall model that emphasizes the importance of testing and verification at each stage of development. The V-model is a useful methodology for hardware development projects where testing and verification are critical.</p>

    <h2>Types of Variables</h2>
    <p>In system development research—especially in IoT and SDG-related studies—different types of variables are used to explain relationships and impacts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent Variable:</strong> The independent variable is the factor that the researcher intentionally introduces or controls to observe its effect.</li>
        <p>Example: Implementation of energy-efficient IoT devices in a smart city.</p>
        <li><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> The dependent variable is the outcome that is measured and is expected to change due to the independent variable.</li>
        <p>Example: Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions</p>
        <li><strong>Moderating Variable:</strong> A moderating variable influences the strength or direction of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.</li>
        <p>Example: Level of government support or incentives</p>
        <li><strong>Mediating Variable:</strong> A mediating variable explains how or why the independent variable affects the dependent variable.</li>
        <p>Example: Decrease in energy consumption by IoT devices</p>
    </ul>

<p><i>In summary, the example provided illustrates how the implementation of energy-efficient IoT devices (independent variable) can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (dependent variable). The relationship between these variables might be affected by the level of government support or incentives (moderating variable) and can be explained through the decrease in energy consumption by IoT devices (mediating variable).</p></i>
